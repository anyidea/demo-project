Write Documentation \u00b6 demo-project could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official demo-project docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such. Submit Feedback \u00b6 The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/anyidea/demo-project/issues. If you are proposing a feature: Explain in detail how it would work.

Pull Request Guidelines \u00b6 Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: The pull request should include tests. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md. The pull request should work for Python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. Check https://github.com/anyidea/demo-project/actions and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
